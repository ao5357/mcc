#Maui College Library
In 2008, as part of a portfolio-building exercise, I did a "standards-based" redesign on the Maui College Library site. This work was hosted on my personal site, hawidu.com, for 4 years for posterity, after getting a little bit of attention on library blogs. This repo keeps the link alive (when I switch my blog over) and will be updated to HTML5 and best practices as I have time to do so.

##Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with Maui College or its library in any way. This design model is for presentation purposes only.
